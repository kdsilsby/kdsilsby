- 👋 Hi, I’m @kdsilsby
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about basic coding, working with data and automation to make daily tasks easier.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning swift and python. I've done a few HTML and Java lessons. 
- 💞️ I don't know if I'm looking to collaborate on a project per se, but I'm interested in interacting with others to help solve small issues about how to program.
- 📫 How to reach me: kdsilsby@gmail.com
